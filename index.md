## Overview

VLM-Mamba introduces a groundbreaking approach to integrating vision and language. This model is the first of its kind built entirely on State Space Models (SSMs), utilizing the innovative Mamba architecture. By leveraging SSMs, VLM-Mamba aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of vision-language tasks, setting a new standard in the field of AI.

## Features

- **State Space Models**: VLM-Mamba employs SSMs for improved performance in understanding and generating language in relation to visual inputs.
- **Mamba Architecture**: This unique architecture is designed to optimize the processing of both visual and textual data.
- **High Efficiency**: Achieves state-of-the-art results with reduced computational overhead.
- **Versatile Applications**: Suitable for various tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and more.

## Architecture

The architecture of VLM-Mamba combines elements from traditional transformers and state space models. Below is a simplified diagram of the architecture:

### Components

1. **Input Layer**: Accepts both visual and textual data.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes convolutional layers for images and embedding layers for text.
3. **State Space Model Integration**: Merges features through SSMs, allowing for dynamic processing of inputs.
4. **Attention Mechanism**: Implements attention to focus on relevant features across both modalities.
5. **Output Layer**: Generates predictions or responses based on the integrated features.

## Usage

### Basic Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started with VLM-Mamba:

```python
import torch
from vlm_mamba import VLM_Mamba

# Load the model
model = VLM_Mamba.load_from_pretrained('path_to_model_weights')

# Prepare input
image = 'path_to_image.jpg'
text = 'Describe the image'

# Run inference
output = model.predict(image, text)
print(output)
```

### Advanced Configuration

You can customize the model parameters by modifying the configuration file. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the key parameters:

- **learning_rate**: Adjust the learning rate for training.
- **batch_size**: Set the number of samples per gradient update.
- **num_epochs**: Specify how many epochs to train.
